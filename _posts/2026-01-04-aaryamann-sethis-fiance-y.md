"30 Bars Ahead: Aaryamann Sethi's Rockin' Birthday Bash"

Tiswas yesterday, Aaryamann Sethi celebrated his 30th birthday, and what a way to kick-start that milestone year? He's not one to go by the numbers, but his special someone Yogita Bihani knew exactly how to make him feel like a rockstar. Gifted him a stunning Rs 2.12 lakh guitar, and let me tell you, it's no ordinary instrument. I mean, you can almost feel the love radiating from the very strings. 'I can only hear money' seems like Yogita's way of saying, "Hey, Aaryamann, you deserve a tangible piece of heaven." The looks, the grins, and the music that's been playing in the background are all the proof of this lovely gesture. Aaryamann, you've just become an official guitar owner, and we can't wait to hear the sweet melodies that'll fill our lives with joy.
