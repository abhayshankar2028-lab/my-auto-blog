In a thrilling conclusion to the Desert Vipers' maiden ILT20 title, a dominant performance from the bowling duo sealed the win. After being asked to bat, the Vipers' batting duo, Peter Curran and Tye Dotchin, put on a record-breaking partnership of 107 runs. However, Curran's innings ultimately fell short, as he was dismissed in a dramatic fashion. The Vipers' bowlers then took to the field, resulting in MIE's collapse.

The bowling trio of Kyle Jamieson, Albert Mabe, and Luke Ronchi delivered a masterclass, restricting MIE to just 108 runs in their allotted 15 overs. The Vipers' victory marked their first ILT20 title, as they edged out their opponents by 3 wickets. The bowling duo's impressive display will be remembered as one of the greatest in the tournament's history. The Desert Vipers' triumph will undoubtedly be a memorable moment in the ILT20 season.
