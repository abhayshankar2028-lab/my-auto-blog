title: "Littler on his next challenger: MVG said a star is born every 17 years!"
---

Luke Littler's reign as the world's number one darts player appears to be drawing to a close. But don't count him out just yet. A dark horse in the darts world is hitting its stride, with a name that has sparked a lot of interest: Mark Walsh. The veteran Welshman is known for his incredible consistency and clutch performances, and he's been building momentum with a remarkable return to the top of the rankings.

MVG, the world's number one darts player, has also been hinting at a new challenger in the works. The legendary legend has stated that a "star is born every 17 years," and it seems that Walsh might be that savior. With his impressive skills and growing reputation, it's likely only a matter of time before he faces off against Littler for the top spot. The likes of Walsh, Peter Wright, and Michael van Gerwen are all vying for the next big challenge in the sport.
