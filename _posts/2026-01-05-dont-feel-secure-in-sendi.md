**A Cautionary Note: Don't Rush to Send Team to India without ICC's Approval**

In light of the India tour, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Shamsuddin Sheikh has cautioned against rushing decisions. When asked about the possibility of sending the team to India, Sheikh emphasized that there's no final word yet from the International Cricket Council (ICC). "Don't feel secure sending our team to India, next steps are still being considered," he stated. This cautionary note highlights the importance of giving the ICC's approval before making any decisions. The BCB president is right; the ICC's decision is crucial in determining the fate of the tour. Until then, fans are left to wait anxiously for the decisive word from the governing body. A wait of several weeks will not be enough for the BCB president to reveal the next steps.
