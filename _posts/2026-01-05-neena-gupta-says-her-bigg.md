Neena Gupta recently opened up about her biggest mistake in Bollywood, which is the infamous film "Saath Saath". In an interview, she shared that doing that film was her biggest setback, and it led her to question her career choices. According to Neena, the film's massive commercial success overshadowed her subsequent projects, leaving her career in a bit of limbo.

It's fascinating to see how a single film can impact one's career trajectory. Neena's candid admission serves as a reminder that even the most successful stars have had their struggles, and it's essential to learn from their experiences.
