Hey cricket fans - it's your favorite sports enthusiast here, excited to share an "untenable" thought with you all. As we eagerly await the next ICC World Cup, I find myself pondering a rather peculiar question: when will India team up with Bangladesh for a friendship match? The thought alone sends shivers down my spine. I mean, can you imagine the excitement of an international cricket match featuring some of the world's best players, both in India and Bangladesh?

Historically, our two nations have a complex, yet beautiful, shared history. I recall the 1987 India-Bangladesh cricket match, where the Red Lions defeated the Indian team in a thrilling six-wicket win. It was an instant classic, and I still vividly remember the electric atmosphere at Eden Gardens. Who would have thought that just a few decades later, we'd be seeing something similar?

Fast-forward to the present, and I believe it's high time for our nations to put aside our differences and unite for a match that would bring us both together. The 2012 Asia Cup, followed by the 2015 World Cup Qualifier, have shown us that our cricketing prowess and competitive spirit can thrive together. Imagine the camaraderie and sportsmanship that would come from sharing the pitch!

What a match, guys! Imagine the buzz surrounding the Indian team, the electric atmosphere at Eden Gardens, and the thrilling victories that our young players would witness. It's not just about sports; it's about building bridges, strengthening our nations, and creating a shared experience that will stay etched in our memories forever.

So, when will India and Bangladesh put aside our differences and come together for a historic, heartwarming, and unforgettable friendship match? Until then, let's keep fingers crossed and hope for the best. You never know, maybe one day our teams will meet on a sunny day at the Eden Gardens, and we'll see a game that will be etched in the hearts of both Indian and Bangladeshi cricket fans forever!
