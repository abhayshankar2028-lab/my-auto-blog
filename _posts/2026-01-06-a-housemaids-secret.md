Domestic Thriller of Unsettling Proportions: "The Housemaid" Review**

**SUMMARY**

Like a masterful tapestry, "The Housemaid" weaves a complex narrative of secrets, lies, and the unyielding bonds of domestic service. A thought-provoking domestic thriller that oscillates between the familiar and the unseen, Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried shine as the unlikely duo at the center of this intricate dance. Their characters are multidimensional, relatable, and eerily familiar, much like the characters in a long-forgotten favorite fairy tale.
