Imagine a grand, majestic theatre, its curtains adorned with the vibrant hues of our beloved stars, who have danced on its stages for decades. The curtains are now closed, and the audience is eager to know: is the legacy of Prabhas alive and well, or is it slowly fading away?

As we sit in the dark, I am reminded of Prabhas' early days in Telugu cinema, his raw energy and charisma captivating audiences. But times have changed, and his films, though critically acclaimed, have struggled to gain traction at the box office. The question is, can Prabhas revive his fading star, or will his legacy be reduced to mere whispers of the past?

Boman Irani's words echo in my mind - 'Prabhas is not a superstar, he's a Telugu boy doing Telugu films.' Those words cut deep, but they also spark a deeper question: what makes a superstar? Is it the silver screen, the applause, or the mere fact that one is a superstar? As we ponder these questions, the curtain rises on a new era of Bollywood, one that may just challenge the status quo and redefine what it means to be a superstar"
