As the curtains of controversy part, the whispers of a new storm brew in the corridors of Bollywood. The once-mighty censor board, a guardian of artistic liberties, now appears fragile and outdated. Its grip is loosening, and the very fabric of the industry is beginning to unravel.

In a shocking statement, Ram Gopal Varma, the legendary filmmaker and director, has unleashed a fiery rebuke against the outdated regulations. "This is an insult to our viewers," he declared, his voice a thunderclap in the frosty air of controversy. "The censor board must evolve, not stagnate." 

Varma's words have struck a chord, echoing through the studios and offices of Bollywood. The industry is abuzz with debate, some hailing the criticism as a necessary shake-up, while others cry out for the return of the traditional 'wall of shame'. As the storm clouds gather, one thing is clear – the battle for artistic freedom has only just begun. The question remains, will the censorship board heed the call of change, or will it succumb to the void of tradition? Only time will tell.
