In the realm of Bollywood, where masks hide behind screens, and the whispers of the past echo through the corridors of fame, a tale of praise and scorn unfolds. The song 'Border 2', penned by the inimitable Anu Malik and composed by Pritam, was once a mere whisper among the fans. Yet, it was the unlikeliest of voices that raised its profile, piercing the veil of anonymity and catapulting it into the stratosphere of viral sensation. Varun Dhawan, the song's stalwart star, has finally acknowledged the catalyst for its ascension, citing the unrelenting onslaught of trolls as the spark that set it ablaze. As the divine message "God is great" echoes through the realm, a question arises: what ignites the flame of fervor? The answer lies in the unbridled passion of those behind the scenes, fueling a fire that burns bright and unyielding.
