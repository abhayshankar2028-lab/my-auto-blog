In the silence that followed, the echoes of a thousand whispers seemed to reverberate, a haunting reminder of the memories that lingered, long after the curtain call had come and gone. The shadows cast by the night seemed to deepen, as if the darkness itself was trying to wrap its icy fingers around the fragile heart of the Bollywood community. It was a somber moment, one that would leave a lasting impact on the lives of those who had known the tragic star.
