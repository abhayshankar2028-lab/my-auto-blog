![** The Unraveling Thread: Ashwin's Lament

**BODY:**

In the tapestry of cricket's rich fabric, a subtle thread is unraveling. Ashwin's words weave a poignant narrative, echoing the whispers of a nation's disappointment. A snub from the selectors has left the Indian bowler yearning for continuity. The once-inseparable duo of Rashid and Ashwin now stands alone, their partnership an enigmatic thread that's been frayed by the whims of fate.

Like a diver's scuba gear, Ashwin's mind is submerged, searching for the depths of the pitch where the magic still lies. His thoughts are a mausoleum of memories, each shot a tombstone marking the passing of time. The roar of the crowd has silenced the whispers, and now the only sound is the rustling of the wind through the whispers of what could have been.

As the curtain falls on the first ODI, the question lingers: what lies ahead for Ashwin, the threads of his destiny still tangled and uncertain? Will he find solace in the shadows, or will the doubts creep in like a thief in the night, snatching the unwary? The answer, much like the game, remains a mystery, hidden beneath the surface, waiting to be unraveled](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/01/arshdeep-ashwin.jpg)
