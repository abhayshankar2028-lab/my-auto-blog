![** The Weight of Memories: Karan Johar's Fainting Fiasco

**BODY:**

In the depths of his past, a forgotten chapter unfolds, a story of weight, of struggles, and of vulnerabilities. Karan Johar, the master of Bollywood's magic, remembers a time when his body betrayed him, his mind shattered by the cruel words of his mother. Fainting in college, he struggled to regain control, his fragile form trembling under the weight of self-doubt. The incriminating testimony of his mother – calling him 'fat' and 'large' – cut deep, a painful reminder of his own inadequacy. Yet, he refused to let it define him, for he is not on Ozempic. Instead, he chose to rise above, to harness the power of his resolve and walk towards a brighter tomorrow. Tonight, we bear witness to the unflinching tale of Karan Johar's journey towards self-discovery, a testament to the indomitable human spirit that never fails to rise.
