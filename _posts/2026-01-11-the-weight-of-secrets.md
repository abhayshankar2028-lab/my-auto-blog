"Whispers of a forgotten past, echoes of a controlled life. Karan Johar, the maestro behind hits like 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' and 'My Name Is Khan,' has revealed a secret that's been hidden beneath the polished facade of Hollywood glamour. In an exclusive interview, the actor shares his harrowing tale of fainting spells while dieting in college. 'My mother called me "fat" and "large"; the weight of those words still haunts me.' Frightful memories of being confined to a hospital bed, his fragile body weakened by the relentless pursuit of a seemingly unattainable ideal. Karan's courageous confession is a testament to the human cost of fame and the chilling consequences of ignoring one's own well-being."
