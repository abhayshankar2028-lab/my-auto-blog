![** Cricket's Fireworks Burst as RCB Soars to Glory

**BODY:**

In the realm of WPL 2026, where lightning-fast drums beat the air,
Two wins are claimed, and the rhythmic melody of triumph does reign.
The stormy seas of competition now part, revealing a victor so fine,
RCB's Harris unleashes a fusillade of fire, leaving all else to decline.

A four-dimensional explosion of power, 85 adorned with finesse,
Harris' 40-ball 85 is a marvel, cementing RCB's dominance in this contest's cauldron.
Like an eblown flame, it fuels the fire, igniting RCB's ascendancy,
Where the siren's call of victory echoes, beckoning all to heed.

The stage is set, the curtains draw, and RCB takes the stage once more,
Determined to prove their mettle, to emerge victorious and pour.
A tale of triumph, of strength, and of hearts that beat as one,
RCB's Harris and team ride the WPL 2026 wave, until the end is won](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/01/grace-harris-narendra-vaskar.jpg)
