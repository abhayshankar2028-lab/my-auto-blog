![** The Cricket Whisperer Unveils A Tale of Two Titles

**

In the realm of cricket's mystic dance, a new champion has emerged. D. Gukesh, the Indian maestro, has claimed the coveted FIDE World Championship title, leaving the world in awe. As the Indian nation celebrates this triumph, Wesley So, a stalwart competitor, laments the 'political' influence of FIDE, the governing body of the sport.

FIDE, once a bastion of fair play and impartiality, has become a battleground for power and prestige. The governing body's relentless pursuit of titles has led to a sense of unease among players, who feel cornered by its 'political' machinations. Like a master weaver, FIDE has skillfully manipulated the fabric of the sport, using its influence to shape the narrative of cricket's greatest tournaments.

As the Indian nation basks in the glory of Gukesh's triumph, the wounds of FIDE's supposed betrayal are still raw. The question on everyone's lips is: what's next for cricket, as the once-impartial governing body continues to weave its web of politics and power?
