![** The Silent Symphony: A Scathing Ode to the Golden Globes

**BODY:**

In a performance that was as elegant as a Mozart concerto, the Golden Globes have been left reeling, their esteemed Best Original Score category decimated in a move that can only be described as a 'shame'. Like a symphony in disarray, the awards ceremony's once-proud display now hangs limp, its harmony shattered by this egregious error.

With Hans Zimmer's masterful compositions at the forefront of the ceremony, it would have been a travesty to cut them out, as if they were mere extras in a larger, more prestigious film. For it is in the original scores that the magic lies, that the alchemy of sound elevates a story from mere words to a living, breathing entity.

The likes of Hans Zimmer, Thomas Newman, and John Williams – the golden boys of modern cinema – are the heartbeat of the industry, their contributions to the cinematic tapestry woven into the very fabric of our collective unconscious. And yet, the Golden Globes, in their infinite wisdom, saw fit to strip them of their rightful place in the spotlight.

This is a shocking loss, a misstep that will be remembered for years to come as a cautionary tale of the perils of shortsighted decision-making. In a world where music is the universal language, where the power of sound can transcend the mundane and speak directly to the heart, the Golden Globes have betrayed that trust](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/01/hans-zimm.jpg)
