![** The Cricketer's Descent into Madness

**BODY:**

In the dimly lit alleys of Mumbai, a crisis brews. Behind the scenes of Bollywood's grandeur, a mole has emerged, whispering demands that could shatter the very fabric of our entertainment industry. The voice of Harsha Bhogle, I was told, brought me to the edge of sanity. The story began when a veteran actor was allegedly coerced into an 8-hour shift with the promise of a hefty pay rise. But what the actor didn't know was that the only thing he received was a nightmarish existence – insect-infested rooms, no beds to call his own, and the constant sting of exhaustion.

As the days blurred into an endless cycle of drudgery, the actor's mind began to unravel. His dreams were haunted by the ghosts of his past, and the only respite came from the dim glow of his phone, which cast a pale light on the desolate landscape of his soul. It's a tale of exploitation, a cautionary story that serves as a reminder that in the cutthroat world of entertainment, the lines between reality and fantasy can become perilously blurred](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/01/Rajendra-Chawla.jpg)
