"The tumultuous turf of the Indian Open has been shrouded in a thick haze of controversy. Anders Antonsen, Denmark's mighty shuttlewing, has pulled out of the tournament, and with him, a toxic knot of pollution hangs in the air. The capital's notorious air quality, a perpetual thorn in the side of global sports, has once again proven its potency. The Indian Open's governing body, in a desperate bid to salvage the event, has yet to address the elephant in the room – the very real concern over Delhi's deteriorating air quality casting a pall over every aspect of the tournament. Will the tournament's organizers heed the warning signs or succumb to the noise of their own self-interest?"
