As the fiery axe rises high in the icy sky, Gerard Butler, an unyielding giant, assumes the mantle of 'Midnight Inferno,' the sequel to Greenland. The unforgiving landscapes of the frozen tundra serve as a backdrop for Butler's unrelenting crusade, driven by a primal urge to reach the elusive shores of freedom. Like a mighty storm brewing, the forces of nature – and human desperation – converge to test the mettle of those who dare to challenge the unforgiving vastness of Greenland. With each step, Butler's rage intensifies, a tempest that ravages the landscape, leaving in its wake a trail of destruction and hope. Will this unyielding hero emerge victorious, or will the unforgiving wilderness consume him whole? The battle for survival rages on, as Butler confronts the darkness that lies at the heart of Greenland 2.
