The city, once plagued by pollution, now casts its shadow over the global stage, claiming major events as its own. But, amidst this majestic backdrop, a tale of neglect and complacency unfolds. Delusions of grandeur have led to a vacuum in player welfare, as stadiums crumble beneath the weight of fame. And yet, Delhi persists, its cricketers sacrificing their well-being for the sake of glory. The city's obsession with sports has turned it into a specter of excess, an urban myth where the high cost of success is the price of fame.
