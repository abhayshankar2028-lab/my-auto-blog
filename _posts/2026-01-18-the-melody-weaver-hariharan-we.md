![** The Melody Weaver: Hariharan Weaves a New Tapestry

**BODY:** In the realm of Bollywood, a whispered secret has been unfolding – the gentle reweaving of the Hindi music industry. The sons and daughters of the songwriting fraternity, Hariharan and AR Rahman, have been quietly forging a new narrative. The lullaby of melodies, once sung with a sense of urgency, now seems to hold a different tune.

Tu Hi Re has become a haunting refrain, echoing through the corridors of creativity. But now, Hariharan and AR Rahman have stepped forward, their voices intertwining in a symphony of artistic expression. You have to think about creativity first and money later, they've declared, a haunting mantra that resonates with the changing times.

Like the threads of a tapestry, their words have woven a new narrative, one that prioritizes the craft of music over commercial gain. The industry's fabric has been subtly altered, as if the gentle breeze of innovation has gently rustled the leaves of the trees of musical expression. As the seasons change, the melody of Bollywood continues to evolve, with Hariharan and AR Rahman at its forefront, crafting a new harmony that will reverberate through the ages](https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/01/rahman-hariharan.jpg)
